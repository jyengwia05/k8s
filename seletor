We have deployed a number of PODs. They are labelled with tier, env and bu. How many PODs exist in the dev environment (env)?
kubectl get pods -l env=dev --no-headers | wc -l

# kubectl get <all,resources> -seletor env=dev --no-headers | wc -l
# kubectl get <all,resources> -seletor env=dev,bu=finance,tier=frontend
